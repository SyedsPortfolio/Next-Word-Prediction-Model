# Objective
The aim is to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context.

# Description
Next Word Prediction means predicting the most likely word or phrase that will come next in a sentence or text. It is like having an inbuilt feature on an application that suggests the next word as you type or speak. The Next Word Prediction Models are used in applications like messaging apps, search engines, virtual assistants, and autocorrect features on smartphones.

## Step-by-step approach
- Start by collecting a diverse dataset of text documents
- Preprocess the data by cleaning and tokenizing it
- Prepare the data by creating input-output pairs
- Engineer features such as word embeddings
- Select an appropriate model like an LSTM or GPT 
- Train the model on the dataset while adjusting hyperparameters
- Improve the model by experimenting with different techniques and architectures
